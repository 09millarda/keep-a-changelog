Hi there,

Please open a pull request with any suggestions you have regarding the
example [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) or the [README](README.md).

Please don't submit pull requests that directly modify the
[`index.html`](index.html) file. It's generated by the
[`generate.thor`](generate.thor) script which I would appreciate you run
before submitting your pull request if you included any changes to
[README](README.md).

You can re-generate the `index.html` from a modified `README.md` by
running `thor generate:index`.

Tweaks, fixes and improvements to any of the [assets](assets/) are also
quite welcome.
