<h1>Keep a CHANGELOG</h1>
<h2>Logging is caring about your open source users.</h2>
<h3>What&#39;s a CHANGELOG?</h3>
<p>A CHANGELOG is a file which contains a curated chronologically ordered list of notable changes for each version of an open source project.</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/changelog_example.png" alt="Changelog Example"></p>
<h3>What&#39;s the point of a CHANGELOG?</h3>
<p>To make it easier for users and contributors to see precisely what notable changes have been made between each release (or version) of the project.</p>
<h3>Why can&#39;t people just use a git log diff?</h3>
<p>Because log diffs are full of noise. Can we really expect every single commit in an open source project to be meaningful and self-explanatory? That seems like a pipe dream.</p>
<h3>Is there a standard CHANGELOG format?</h3>
<p>Sadly, no, but this is something I want to change. This project <a href="CHANGELOG.md">contains what I hope will become the standard CHANGELOG file</a> for all open source projects, so take a look at it and please suggest improvements.</p>
<h3>What makes up a good CHANGELOG?</h3>
<p>I&#39;m glad you asked, since I have quite a few opinions about that.</p>
<ul>
<li>a good CHANGELOG is made for humans, not machines, so it should be very legible.</li>
<li>the sub-sections of a CHANGELOG should be based on releases or versions.</li>
<li>each version should come with a release date in a sensible format: YYYY-MM-DD.</li>
<li>within each release, changes should be classified in specific sections that describe their impact on the project:
<ul>
<li><code>Added</code> for anything new: features, APIs, etc.</li>
<li><code>Deprecated</code> for previously stable features that will be removed in upcoming releases.</li>
<li><code>Removed</code> for previously stable features that are removed in this release.</li>
<li><code>Fixed</code> for any bug fixes.</li>
<li><code>Security</code> to invite users to upgrade in case of vulnerabilities and exposures.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>each section and sub-section of a CHANGELOG should be easily linked to (hence Markdown over plain text)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Can CHANGELOG files be automatically parsed?</h3>
<p>As the good people maintaining Gemnasium know too well, it&#39;s very hard. That&#39;s because people follow wildly different formats for their files. Again, I hope to change that, but in the meantime, you might be interested in <a href="https://github.com/tech-angels/vandamme">Vandamme</a>, a Ruby gem used by Gemnasium to parse many open source project CHANGELOGs.</p>
<h3>Why do you keep writing CHANGELOG in all caps?</h3>
<p>You&#39;re right, that is a bit shouty. Maybe it&#39;s because of the de facto convention that files pertaining to an open source project should be in all caps, for instance: <a href="README.md"><code>README</code></a>, <a href="LICENSE"><code>LICENSE</code></a>, <a href="CONTRIBUTING.md"><code>CONTRIBUTING</code></a>.</p>
<p>I like it because it denotes that these files are metadata for the project, similarly to <a href="http://shields.io/">open source project badges</a> they draw attention to themselves as information people should be aware of if they mean to use the project or contribute to it.</p>
