<h1>Keep a CHANGELOG</h1>
<h2>It&#39;s good for open source projects &amp; their users.</h2>
<h3>What&#39;s a CHANGELOG?</h3>
<p>A CHANGELOG is a file which contains a curated chronologically ordered 
list of notable changes for each version of an open source project.</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/changelog_example.png" alt="Changelog Example"></p>
<h3>What&#39;s the point of a CHANGELOG?</h3>
<p>To make it easier for users and contributors to see precisely what 
notable changes have been made between each release (or version) of the project.</p>
<h3>What makes up a good CHANGELOG?</h3>
<p>I&#39;m glad you asked.</p>
<ul>
<li>It&#39;s made for humans, not machines, so legibility is crucial.</li>
<li>One sub-section per versions.</li>
<li>Versions should come with a release date in a sensible format: YYYY-MM-DD.</li>
<li>Changes should be grouped to describe their impact on the project:
<ul>
<li><code>Added</code> for new features.</li>
<li><code>Deprecated</code> for once stable features removed in upcoming releases.</li>
<li><code>Removed</code> for deprecated features removed in this release.</li>
<li><code>Fixed</code> for any bug fixes.</li>
<li><code>Security</code> to invite users to upgrade in case of vulnerabilities.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Each section should be easily linked to â€” hence Markdown over plain text.</li>
</ul>
<p>It&#39;s also good to mention whether the project 
follows <a href="http://semver.org/">Semantic Versioning</a>.</p>
<h3>Is there a standard CHANGELOG format?</h3>
<p>Sadly, no, but this is something I want to change. This project 
<a href="CHANGELOG.md">contains what I hope will become the standard CHANGELOG file</a> 
for all open source projects, so take a look at it and please suggest improvements.</p>
<p>The maintainers of <a href="http://tech-angels.github.io/vandamme/#changelogs-convention">Vandamme</a>
have established interesting conventions, most of which are sensible.</p>
<h3>What should the CHANGELOG file be named?</h3>
<p>Well, if you can&#39;t tell from the example above, <code>CHANGELOG.md</code> is the 
best convention so far.</p>
<p>Some projects also use <code>HISTORY.txt</code>, <code>HISTORY.md</code>, <code>History.md</code>, <code>NEWS.txt</code>, 
<code>NEWS.md</code>, <code>News.txt</code>, <code>RELEASES.txt</code>, <code>RELEASE.md</code>, <code>releases.md</code>, etc.
It&#39;s a mess, that only makes it harder for people to find it.</p>
<h3>Why can&#39;t people just use a git log diff?</h3>
<p>Because log diffs are full of noise. Can we really expect every single 
commit in an open source project to be meaningful and self-explanatory? 
That seems like a pipe dream.</p>
<h3>Can CHANGELOG files be automatically parsed?</h3>
<p>It&#39;s hard because people follow wildly different formats and file names. 
The aforementioned <a href="https://github.com/tech-angels/vandamme/">Vandamme</a> 
is a Ruby gem used by <a href="http://gemnasium.com">Gemnasium</a> which parses many 
(but not all) open source project CHANGELOGs.</p>
<h3>Why do you keep writing CHANGELOG in all caps?</h3>
<p>You&#39;re right, that is a bit shouty. Maybe it&#39;s because of the de facto 
convention that files pertaining to an open source project should be in 
all caps, for instance: <a href="README.md"><code>README</code></a>, <a href="LICENSE"><code>LICENSE</code></a>, 
<a href="CONTRIBUTING.md"><code>CONTRIBUTING</code></a>.</p>
<p>It denotes that these files are metadata for the project, similarly to 
<a href="http://shields.io/">open source project badges</a> they draw attention to 
themselves as information people should be aware of if they mean to use 
the project or contribute to it.</p>
